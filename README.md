## Exploring US Bikeshare Data

## Description 

***Explore US Bikeshare Data*** is a Python-based interactive program that allows users to explore bikeshare usage data from three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This project was developed as part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.

Using real-world datasets, the program provides users with insights into bikeshare trends by calculating descriptive statistics based on user-specified filters such as city, month, and day of the week.

This project: 

- Prompts the user to choose a city and optionally filter the data by month and day of the week.

- Loads and filters the data based on user input.

- Calculates and displays statistics, including:

    - The most common month, day, and start hour of travel

    - The most popular start and end stations and most frequent trips

    - Total and average trip duration

    - Counts of user types, genders, and birth year statistics (when available)

- Displays raw data in increments of 5 rows upon user request.

- Allows restarting the analysis to explore different filters without restarting the script.
